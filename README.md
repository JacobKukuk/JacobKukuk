# Full-Stack Developer | Systems Engineer | Digital Polymath

I blend code, infrastructure, and creativity to build reliable systems and user friendly tools across courtrooms, campuses, and the cloud.

### Self-Taught Excellence  
I didn’t follow the usual tech path. I learned through doing, reading docs, experimenting, and solving problems hands-on. That same drive keeps me learning every day.

### Versatile Problem Solver  
From full-stack apps to enterprise systems, I’ve built, fixed, and scaled it all. I focus on crafting tools that last, perform, and make people’s work easier.

### Community Impact  
I use tech to give back. I lead **Vegas Open Network (VONet)**, a nonprofit project bringing fair and open internet access to underserved communities through mesh networking.
